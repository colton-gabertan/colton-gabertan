### Hi there, I'm Colton ðŸ‘‹ 

## I like to work on Cybersecurity and Software Engineering!

- ðŸ”­ I teach as a CodePath Tech Fellow: [AppSec Cybersecurity][course]!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying at the University of Nevada Las Vegas
- ðŸ¥… Goals: Publish writeups/ Contribute to open source/ Share interesting code
- Side Note: I participated in my first NSA CodeBreaker Challenge this year, and achieved high performer status, standing at the top of all the Nevada universities that competed. I plan to publish my writeup here as soon as the challenge ends!
